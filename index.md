## About

I'm a neuroscientist working to figure out how the brain wires itself together. A better understanding of functional brain development is crucial for the prevention or treatment of many, if not all, neurological diseases, as well as realizing self-organization in the robotic systems of the future.

My research involves generating, exploring, and visualizing a considerable amount of data regarding the functional dynamics among synaptic connections in the nervous system. To help accomplish this, data wrangling is necessary-- writing R, matlab, python, and unix shell code to manage, assemble, and analyze measurements made in our experiments.
